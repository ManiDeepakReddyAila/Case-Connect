AMMONS DEVELOPMENT GROUP, INC.; East Coast Drilling & Blasting, Inc.; Scott Carle; and Juan Albino, Defendants.\"** In this case, Francisco Fagundes was injured during a blasting operation, which is considered an \"ultrahazardous\" activity. He attempted to sue his employer in court, arguing that due to the inherent risks of his job, he should be able to pursue a strict liability claim outside of the workers\\' compensation system. \\n\\nHowever, the court ruled against Fagundes, emphasizing that the workers\\' compensation system provides the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries, including those sustained in ultrahazardous jobs. The court further noted that exceptions to this rule are very narrow and generally require proving that the employer engaged in misconduct knowing it was substantially certain to cause serious injury or death, a standard Fagundes did not meet.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on this, you can refer to the case opinion:\\n\\n**Case ID:** 12647232\\n\\n**Case Name:** Francisco FAGUNDES and Desiree Fagundes, Plaintiffs, v.
